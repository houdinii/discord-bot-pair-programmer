Memory System Cog for PairProgrammer Discord Bot

This cog provides a comprehensive memory management system that allows users
to save, retrieve, and organize important information within Discord channels.
It uses vector database storage for semantic search and persistent memory
across conversations.

Key Features:
    - Tagged memory storage with semantic search
    - Channel-based memory isolation
    - Content-based memory retrieval
    - Memory management (save, recall, list, delete)
    - Vector database statistics and debugging
    - Automatic timestamping and metadata

Memory Types:
    - Project information and decisions
    - Technical specifications and requirements
    - Team agreements and conventions
    - Important links and resources
    - Meeting notes and action items

Commands:
    - !remember: Save tagged memories
    - !recall: Search memories by content
    - !get_memory: Retrieve specific memory by tag
    - !list_memories: List all saved memories
    - !forget: Delete memories by tag
    - !stats: Show vector database statistics
    - !debug_memories: Debug memory storage issues

Integration:
    - VectorService: Vector database operations
    - Channel isolation: Each Discord channel has separate memory space
    - AI Context: Memories automatically included in AI responses

    Discord cog for persistent memory and information management.
    
    This cog enables users to create a persistent knowledge base within

        Debug memory storage and retrieval for troubleshooting issues.
        
        Provides detailed diagnostic information about memory storage,
        search functionality, and database connectivity. Useful for
        troubleshooting when memories aren't saving or retrieving correctly.
        
        Diagnostic Checks:
            - Vector database connectivity
            - Total vector count across all channels
            - Channel-specific memory search
            - Sample memory retrieval
            - Search functionality testing
            
        Debug Information Displayed:
            - Total vectors in database
            - Current Discord channel ID
            - Number of memories found in current channel
            - Sample search results with scores
            - Memory metadata and types
            
        Search Test:
            Performs a test search using common keywords:
            "project React Node PostgreSQL JWT API"
            This helps verify that:
            - Search functionality is working
            - Memories are properly indexed
            - Relevance scoring is functioning
            
        Troubleshooting Use Cases:
            - Memories not appearing in !list_memories
            - !recall command returning no results
            - Vector database connection issues
            - Channel isolation problems
            
        Common Issues Diagnosed:
            - Empty vector database
            - Channel ID mismatches
            - Indexing failures
            - Search query problems
            - Metadata corruption
            
        Debug Output Includes:
            - Vector database statistics
            - Channel-specific information
            - Search result samples
            - Memory type distribution
            - Relevance scores for validation
            
        Example:
            !debug_memories
            !dm
            !checkmem
