Administrative Commands for PairProgrammer Discord Bot

This cog provides administrative commands for database management and
bot maintenance. All commands require Discord Administrator permissions
and should be used with caution, especially destructive operations.

Commands:
    !initdb: Initialize database tables
    !dropdb: Drop all database tables (destructive, requires confirmation)

Security:
    - All commands require Discord Administrator permissions
    - Destructive commands require explicit confirmation
    - Operations are logged for audit purposes
